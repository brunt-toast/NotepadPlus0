Notepad, and nothing more.

In light of Microsoft's adding tabs, "Define with Bing" and, more recently, ["AI experiences"](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/06/new-ai-experiences-for-paint-and-notepad-begin-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/), notepad is straying from what it used to be. This app looks and feels like the default Windows 11 experience, without the [ens***tification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification).
